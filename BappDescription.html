<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automatically decodes nested Unicode sequences in HTTP messages</li>
  <li>Adds a custom tab for viewing the unescaped content of selected requests and responses</li>
  <li>Provides "pretty print" functionality for JSON content</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select a request or response in the HTTP history or other Burp tool.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the "UnUnicode" tab to view the decoded version of the message.</li>
  <li>Use the decoded output to better understand any obfuscated content.</li>

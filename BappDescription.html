<p>UnUnicode is a Burp extension for unescaping unicode-escaped sequences. Its developed using the Burp Suite Montoya API and supports websockets. While its primary purpose is to handle unicode-escaped sequences, please note that it does not perfectly convert double-byte characters such as emojis. Despite this limitation, it remains a useful tool for routine tasks involving unicode characters.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This extension is versatile, working with any content type. However, the pretty print feature is currently implemented for JSON content only.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The UnUnicode extension is quite straightforward to use. Once installed, it automatically transforms unicode-escaped sequences into their unescaped forms, enhancing the readability of the data being examined. It lacks a specific user interface, instead running in the background to process and convert unicode-escaped sequences without user intervention.</p>
